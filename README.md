# jupyterLab Submissions 

This will be our repo for submitting and editing the Jupyter Notebooks. Please submit your notebook(s) by creating a separate branch with a name that's easy to identify. Then, create an issue with the name of the jupyter notebook and a link to the file in the subject line.

Make sure you assign @uGokalp (Umur Gokalp) to the issue.

Thanks a lot!
